# A Model for Privacy-Preserving Event-Ambivalent Notifications

The latex workflow is based on my basic [latex paper
template](https://github.com/judgegrubb/latex-paper-template) and uses the
[latexrun](https://github.com/aclements/latexrun) project to keep things simple
for compiling code and dealing with dependencies and error messages. You need
to have latex installed in order to use latexrun.
